# Fixture QA missing invariant

## Source of Intent

- Intent: `_docs/intent/Workflow/why-first-fixture/decision.md`

## Quality Goal

This fixture must fail because it omits an `INV-001` style invariant.

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC-001: Missing invariants are rejected.

## Intent-derived Invariants

- Missing on purpose.

## Risk Assessment

Risk: Medium.

## Test Strategy

Use `validate-qa.mjs` in fixture mode.

## Test Matrix

| ID | Source | Requirement / Invariant | Test Type | Command / File | Expected Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC-001 | fixture | Invalid fixture fails. | validator | `deno run --allow-read scripts/validate-qa.mjs --fixture _evals/validator-fixtures/qa/invalid/missing-invariant.md` | Validator exits non-zero. | planned |
